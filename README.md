# USC Core — Universal Semantic Container (Experimental)

**Author:** Raj Mitra (Visionary RM)

USC is an experimental language and container format for embedding **text, code, images, audio, databases, and executable logic** into a single symbolic, human-readable file.

Unlike Markdown or PDF, USC allows **symbols themselves** to carry meaning, payloads, and logic.

---

## Status

⚠️ Experimental / Research Phase (v0.1)

The specification, syntax, and execution model are evolving.

---

## Core Ideas

- Everything is symbolic
- One symbol can expand into massive meaning
- Media and data appear as dense code blocks
- Users control whether symbols act as text, embeds, logic, or hybrids
